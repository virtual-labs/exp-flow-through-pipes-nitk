###### Refer Moodyâ€™s chart wherever required for friction factor.

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li> What is the skin frictional loss when water is flowing at 1.65 m/s through a horizontal 33m long pipe having inside diameter of 2.067inches and absolute roughness 0.0018 inch.
<br> Use the following data:<br>

- Density of water = 995 kg/m<sup>3</sup>,
- viscosity of water = 0.85cP<br>

Assume that inlet and exit points are at the same elevation and entrance and exit losses are negligible.</li>

<li>Water with a coefficient of dynamic viscosity of 1.4 x 10 -3 NS/m<sup>2</sup> flows along a pipe 50mm diameter. If the pipe has an absolute roughness of 0.0000 7m, </br>calculate:<br>
a. The head lost due to friction per km of pipe<br>
b. The power required to overcome friction per km of pipe<br>
  (i) For a flow rate of 3 litres/min<br>
  (ii) For a flow rate of 40 litres/min</li><br>

<li>Pressure drop in a water pipeline with turbulent flow is 25 psi for ordinary steel pipe. What would the pressure drop be if copper pipe were used? Hint: use coefficient of roughness</li>
